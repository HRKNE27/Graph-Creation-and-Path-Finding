This algorithm has broad applications such as finding the shortest path between the current location and the destination in apps like Google maps. The algorithm builds a set of vertices that have the minimum distance from the source, this algorithm is a greedy algorithm.\n",

    "Bellman-Ford Algorithm is similar to Dijkstra's algorithm in that it is an algorithm that tries to find the shortest path between a source vertex and any other vertex reachable from that source vertex. The biggest difference between the two algorithms is that the Bellman-Ford algorithm will work on a graph with negative weights. However, the draw back is that Dijkstra's algorithm has a faster runtime compared to the Bellman-Ford algorithm\n",
    "- Bellman-Ford algorithm has a runtime of $\\theta$(|V|*|E|) where |V| is the number of vertices and |E| is the number of edges\n",

Each iteration tries to find a better path by adding one more edge. (i.e. on the i-th iteration it tries to find lowest cost path of i edges from source to each vertex)\n",

    "- The algorithm will not work with a graph that has a negative weight cycle\n",

    "\t- You can think of an undirected edge as a two way directed edge with one going from vertex u to v and another going from v to u\n",
    "    - If there is a negative undirected edge weight, this is basically a negative weight cycle because the algorithm can keep going from u to v and vice versa\n",

    "## Conclusion and Applications\n",
    "As mentioned above, finding shortest path in a graph is applicable to a maps app like Google Maps, but there are a lot of other real life applications that can be used. For example, this can be used for social networking apps, telephone networking, and IP routing to find open shortest path. It is clear that graphs can be used to represent a lot of real life situations and finding shortest path between two vertices is fundamental to graph theory since the goal is to optimize applications."
